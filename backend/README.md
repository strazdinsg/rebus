# Rebus backend

The backend for the [Rebus system](..). A Spring Boot application.

# Getting started

First you need to ensure the following requirements are met:
- You need to have an SQL database running where the data will be stored. It is suggested to use 
  MySQL, but other SQL databases should work as well.
- TODO - describe necessary environment variables

You can start the backend by executing `mvn spring-boot:run` in the terminal. 

During development can simply run `RebusApplication.main()` method from your IDE.
